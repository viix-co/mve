# Introduction ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simonfuhrmann/mve.svg?branch=master)

The Multi-View Environment, MVE, is an implementation of a complete
end-to-end pipeline for image-based geometry reconstruction. It features
Structure-from-Motion, Multi-View Stereo and Surface Reconstruction.
Further, this is an effort to ease the work with multi-view datasets and
to support the development of algorithms based on multiple views. MVE has
been developed at the TU Darmstadt by Michael Goesele's research group,
and is cucrently in maintenance mode, i.e., new features are rarely added.

This README covers compilation and basic information about the pipeline.
For documentation, please refer to the Wiki pages on GitHub.

MVE is written in C++ and comes with a set of easy-to-use, cross-platform
libraries. The code runs on Linux, MacOS X and (sometimes) Windows. MVE has
minimal dependencies on external libraries; it depends on `libpng`,
`libjpeg` and `libtiff`. A front-end QT-based application called UMVE is
built on top of these libraries, for visualization of the datasets.

Ultimate MVE - front-end Qt-based application called UMVE — is built on top of these libraries, for inspection of the datasets.

# Building MVE and UMVE

To download and build MVE, type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve.git
    $ cd mve
    $ make -j8

To compile and run UMVE, the Qt user interface, type:

    $ cd apps/umve/
    $ qmake && make -j8
    $ ./umve

System requirements to compile and run MVE or UVME are:

 * libjpeg (for MVE, http://www.ijg.org/)
 * libpng (for MVE, http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
 * libtiff (for MVE, http://www.libtiff.org/)
 * OpenGL (for libogl in MVE and UMVE)
 * Qt 5 (for UMVE, http://www.qt.io)

Windows and OS X: Please refer to the Wiki pages for instructions.


# The Reconstruction Pipeline

The MVE reconstruction pipeline is composed of the following components:

 * Creating a dataset, by converting input photos into the MVE File Format.
 * Structure from Motion, which reconstructs the camera parameters.
 * Multi-View Stereo, which reconstructs dense depth maps for each photo.
 * Surface Reconstruction, which reconstructs a surface mesh.

The individual steps of the pipeline are available as command line applications
in the `mve/apps/` directory. Please refer to the
[MVE Users Guide](https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve/wiki/MVE-Users-Guide)
for a more detailed description how to use these tools. Note that UMVE is
merely an interface for scene inspection and does not support reconstruction.
